4. FCC Si density of states
===========================

Let us continue with the `VASP`_ tutorials. In particular, let us now extract
the `density of states for FCC Si`_ as done in the second tutorial. We will from here
and in the rest of the tutorials not run `VASP`_ in the regular manner and leave those
exercise to the reader. Please do so, to appreciate how much simpler `AiiDA-VASP`_ makes
these operations, in particular when you need to perform many or repeat calculations.

Again, we assume you have completed the :ref:`previous tutorial<tutorial_fcc_si_step3>`.

As you might have noticed we have now populated the database with the silicon structure
multiple times. Let us try instead to load some of the structures that already are present
to save coding, reuse previous results and save data storage.

In :ref:`previous tutorial<tutorial_fcc_si_step3>`, when developing the call script,
we set the ``label``. Please inspect this. E.g. for a lattice constant of 3.9, the ``label`` is
set to ``silicon_at_3_9``. Remember also that we cannot modify structures already present in
the database. If we want to do this, we need to create a new
:py:class:`Structure Data<aiida.orm.StructureData>` using the stored entry as an initializer.
In this case we will not modify the structure, so we will simply use the unmodified one.

#. Let us first create a simple call script that uses the :ref:`vasp_workchain`:

   .. literalinclude:: ../../../tutorials/run_fcc_si_dos.py

   Or you can download it::
     
     %/$ wget https://github.com/aiida-vasp/aiida-vasp/raw/develop/tutorials/run_fcc_si_dos.py

   Where we have modified the input parameters according to the tutorial
   `density of states for FCC Si`_. And importantly, we have also told the parser to
   give us the density of states.
   
#. And execute it::

     %/$ python run_fcc_si_dos.py

#. After a while we check the status::

     %/$ verdi process list -a
     PK  Created    Process label                 Process State      Process status

     Log messages
     ---------------------------------------------
     There are 1 log messages for this calculation
     Run 'verdi process report 103820' to see them

   And as you can see, ``dos`` is now listed in the output.

   Now, as you may already know, running with such a dense k-point grid for the initial
   calculation is usually not a good idea. It is more efficient to pre-converge the
   electronic states using a more sparse k-point grid and then restart the calculation
   using a more dense k-point grid when calculating the density of states.
