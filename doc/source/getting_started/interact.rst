6. How to interact with AiiDA
=============================

There are multiple ways to interact with `AiiDA`_. Please consult the `documentation <https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/working_with_aiida/index.html>`_ for a detailed overview. The first you should learn to know and master is the ``verdi`` command and we will now utilize that to set up and configure
`AiiDA`_ such that we finally are able to use it to master `VASP`_ calculations. Notice that
you can during a ``verdi`` executed command always enter ``?`` to get more information about e.g.
a question that is being asked.
