`AiiDA`_ utilizes the concept of a `Workchain`_ as a building block to creating more complex workflows. AiiDA-VASP honours this. The idea is that the workchains should be modular such that one can pick what is needed and build a workflow that suits the problem at hand. Similar to `Calculation`_, the `Workchain`_ is a special class in `AiiDA`_ that is derived from a `Process`_ class.

A `Workchain`_ can be loaded by utilizing the :py:class:`aiida.plugins.WorkflowFactory`::

  $ some_workchain = WorkflowFactory('<plugin_namespace>.<workchain_name>')

from the ``verdi shell``. If you want to load it from a python script, please have a look at `verdi_shell`_. The ``<plugin_namespace>`` is always ``vasp`` for the AiiDA-VASP plugin. The ``<workchain_name>`` is the name of the file containing the module. For instance, for the :ref:`vasp_workchain` we would issue::

  $ vasp_workchain = WorkflowFactory('vasp.vasp')

Workchains should be placed in the ``aiida_vasp/workchains`` folder.

AiiDA-VASP is delivered with several preconstructed workchains to perform dedicated tasks and we believe these, instead the the :ref:`calculations` should be the main entry point for users. They are currently:

- ``vasp.vasp``
- ``vasp.verify``
- ``vasp.relax``
- ``vasp.converge``
- ``vasp.bands``
- ``vasp.master``

where are explained as follows.

.. _vasp_workchain_doc:

VASP workchain
------------------
This performs the low level interactions with the :ref:`vasp_calculation` and is accesible by utilizing the :py:class:`aiida.plugins.WorkflowFactory` with the key ``vasp.vasp``. For additional details on how to interact with this workchain, see :ref:`vasp_workchain`.

.. _verify_workchain_doc:

Verify workchain
--------------------
This is constructed to handle input/output verifications that is not related to numerics or the construction of combinations of workchains and calls :ref:`vasp_workchain_doc`. Currently, this workchain is not doing anything. For additional details on how to interact with this workchain, see :ref:`verify_workchain`.

.. _relax_workchain_doc:

Relaxation workchain
------------------------
This handles the process of relaxing the structure and calls :ref:`verify_workchain_doc`. For additional details on how to interact with this workchain, see :ref:`relax_workchain`.

.. _converge_workchain_doc:

Convergence workchain
-------------------------
This checks the k-point grid and plane wave cutoff for convergence on selected parameters and calls :ref:`relax_workchain_doc`. For additional details on how to interact with this workchain, see :ref:`converge_workchain`. We consider this the main entrypoint for a regular calculation with `VASP`_.

.. _bands_workchain_doc:

Bands workchain
-------------------
This enables the calculation of electronic band structures by standardizing the selected paths in reciprocal space using `SeeKpath`_. This internally calls the :ref:`vasp_workchain_doc`. For additional details on how to interact with this workchain, see :ref:`bands_workchain`. If a user wants to calculate the electronic band structure, they should use the :ref:`master_workchain_doc` as the main entry point.

.. _master_workchain_doc:

Master workchain
--------------------
The idea of this workchain is to ultimately be the main entry point, such that a user can select what properties to be calculated. Then the master workchain composes a workflow to enable such extraction. Currently only the calculation of the electronic band structure is enabled. But this serves as a nice introductory example that can be easily expandedand calls any relevant workchain, depending on the chosen input parameters. For additional details on how to interact with this workchain, see :ref:`master_workchain`.
