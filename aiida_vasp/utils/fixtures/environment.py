"""
Fixtures related to environments.

---------------------------------
Here we set up pytest fixtures that yield the correct AiiDA environment
to run our tests. In particular, the fresh_aiida_env is crucial in order
to set up a dummy database and configuration that can be used during
testing. AiiDA contributes with its own fixture manager, which we use.
