    Base restart workchain

    This workchain serves as the starting point for more complex workchains that will be designed to
    run a calculation that might need multiple restarts to come to a successful end. These restarts
    may be necessary because a single calculation run is not sufficient to achieve a fully converged
    result, or certain errors maybe encountered which are recoverable.

    This workchain implements the most basic functionality to achieve this goal. It will launch
    calculations, restarting until it is completed successfully or the maximum number of iterations
    is reached. It can recover from simple submission failures and will handle any other errors through
    any of the error handlers that have been provided.

    The idea is to subclass this workchain and leverage the generic error handling that is implemented
    in the few outline methods. Part of the suggested outline would look something like the following::

        cls.init_context
        while_(cls.run_calculations)(
            cls.run_calculation,
            cls.verify_calculation,
        )

    Each of these methods can of course be overriden but they should be general enough to fit most
    calculation cycles. The run_calculation method will take the inputs for the calculation process
    from the context under the key 'inputs'. The user should therefore make sure that before the
    run_calculation method is called, that the to be used inputs are stored under self.ctx.inputs.
    One can update the inputs based on the results from a prior calculation by calling an outline
    method just before the run_calculation step, for example::

        cls.init_context
        while_(cls.run_calculations)(
            cls.prepare_calculation,
            cls.run_calculation,
            cls.verify_calculation,
        )

    Where in the prepare_calculation method, the inputs dictionary at self.ctx.inputs is updated
    before the next calculation will be run with those inputs.
